# Not a real Screenreader

Experimental test tool for screenreader output of websites - navigate through a web page with a graphical user interface. No need to (immediately) learn operating a screenreader with shortcuts to experience accessibility issues. Learning tool for (sighted) devs, who are starting their a11y journey.

‚ö†Ô∏è Always use a real screenreader for serious accessibility testing! This is just an experimental learning tool for web accessibility. ‚ö†Ô∏è

Built with electron, puppeteer, puppeteer-in-electron, say, chalk, bulma. Puppeteer allows accessing the accessibility tree since version 3.0.0. See **[accessibility.snapshot()](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v9.1.1&show=api-class-accessibility).**

(This version currently uses a workaround to interact with the nodes, thanks to https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/3641#issuecomment-655639166)

üé• Demo video II: (coming soon)

## Run

- `npm install`
- `npm start`

Default example page: https://dequeuniversity.com/library/aria/simple-dialog - try to open and close the modal :-)

Tested with node v14.17.3

## Current limitations

```
Current focused element in WebArea: {
  nodeId: '7014',
  ignored: false,
  role: { type: 'role', value: 'button' },
  name: {
    type: 'computedString',
    value: 'JavaScript',
    sources: [ [Object], [Object], [Object], [Object] ]
  },
  properties: [
    { name: 'focusable', value: [Object] },
    { name: 'focused', value: [Object] },
    { name: 'expanded', value: [Object] }
  ],
  childIds: [ '7243' ],
  backendDOMNodeId: 53
} nodeId 7014
```

- does not work with childIds currently
- does not support going into subgroups, very basic implementation
- does not check for expanded=true/false yet
- does not support form input (text input) yet
- speech output has no language support, maybe use another library?
- does not support all focus changes yet

## Background

Initial goal: Provide a simple screenreader test tool for devs to recognize accessibility issues. It should work without the need of learning screenreader shortcuts beforehand. 

Also a simple cross browser solution would be a big win I guess.

I also experimented with a chrome extension, but chrome won't allow dispatching keyboard events of tabulator key to shift the focus in the browser (most likely because security). See https://github.com/mandrasch/not-a-real-screenreader-chrome-extension for source code. Puppeteer allows sending tab key events to the browser.

Disclaimer: I'm an a11y newbie, feedback is welcome. I try to respect *Nothing About Us Without Us* as much as possible.
